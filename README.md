- Using Shakespear Data, Train model.


- We want to generate model that when we put sentence, generate shakespearlike sentence.


- Summarize the structure of whole code in "RNN-LSTM_Structure.hwp"


- To train, You should implement train.py


- After training, to sample the 'novel' from training model, Implement Sample.py
